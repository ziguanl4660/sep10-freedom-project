                    I chose to research the topic about car engines. I thought my my backup plan would be about cars in general. 
                    I feel like this would benefit us because when you are accelerating the electric motor can switch on and when you want top speed the gas motor can turn on which in return is better for the environment and for racing and more quiet cars. We would also burn way less fuel when we press the pedal as that part consumes the most gas.

                          <p class="card-text">The current technology with car engines aren't efficient as they either use gas or electric and they burn alot of fuel. They release alot more CO2 into the atmosphere as stepping on the gas burns the most fuel. We can eliminate that emission while still having the feeling of a gas car with the hybrid engines. The problem with current engines is that they are too slow while accelerating and electric will almost always be better while doing so.</p>

                          <p class="card-text">The hybrid technology with car engines will make them very efficient and eco-friendly. This will release no CO2 into the atmosphere as ost of the energy comes from nuclear power plants which dont realease Carbon while producing energy. This will also allow the driver to feel the power of the gas motor while they can go very fast. They have no kickbacks or drawbacks. This would make the engines and the whole car bigger and more exspensive.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
          <p >
            In conclusion, hybrid cars are better if you care more about the environment and want moer mileage because you need to travel further. They while consuming more gas are slow and power-hungry while they are accelerating. This is the opposite with hybrid engines as they are way more eco-friendly while you can travel further then a full electric car. You will get less on a full tank. They hybrid cars will cost way more with a bigger body as they need tobuild more parts and fit more into the body frame. This will drive up the prices but in return help the environment. Thank you for listening.
